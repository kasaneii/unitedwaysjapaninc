## 🚀 The Problem & Solution
**The Problem:** Foreign residents and job seekers in Japan often face significant hurdles due to cultural gaps and complex workplace etiquette. United Ways Japan needed a professional website to deliver valuable resources and cultural insights that could help international talent thrive and businesses grow.

**The Solution:** I developed a content-rich website that serves as a bridge for the international community. By integrating real-life stories, expert guides, and practical advice into a clean, accessible UI, the platform empowers users to navigate Japanese life and workplace culture with confidence.
